# Next.js - 7GUIs

This is my implementation of the [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/) exercise.

Keep in mind this is my first React project. Be lenient.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
